A boilerplate for Angular Apps using Browserify for modularity and Gulp as build tool.

It includes some sample controllers, a service and a directive.

Gulp tasks include watching js/sass and building, as well as a simple (live reloading) webserver with html5 url support

## How to install

- Clone the app
- run npm install
- run gulp
- Build something awesome

When gulp is active, your app will be available at http://localhost:5000 and will be live reloaded when you change any SASS or JS files
